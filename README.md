### How to Run: Windows

1. Install and set up python, the version of python we used was Python 3.9.2 
2. Download the ZIP file of the Source Code from github and extract that file. 
3. Go to our project's directory in the terminal. (I prefer to do this from VS Code but the terminal works as well, for VS Code open the extracted folder and press Ctrl + ` to open the terminal in the project's directory.

4. In the terminal, type: 
 ```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
to install all requirements needed for our project to run (due to version differences you might need to use pip3 instead of pip)

5. Once everything is downloaded successfully, in the terminal type:
```
python main.py
```
To execute the project (might need to use python3 instead of python)

6. If done successfully, "Running on: http://127.0.0.1" Should appear, ctrl + click on the link and it should lead you to our project's webpage.
